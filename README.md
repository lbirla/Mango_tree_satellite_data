# Remote Sensing and Deep Learning based Tree Counting in Mango Orchard using Improved Version of YOLOv8: BiFPN-YOLOv8m
This dataset contains high-resolution remote sensing images of the district of Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh, India. The images extracted are in the visible range of the spectrum and have a resolution of 1162 x 632. The images representing various regions of the orchard containing four (Alphonso, Dasheri, Langra, and Chausa) varieties of mango trees, young and old, intermixed with other vegetation, were handpicked to prepare a diverse dataset. Images containing trees that seemed ambiguous through visual inspection were cropped to remove the ambiguity.
