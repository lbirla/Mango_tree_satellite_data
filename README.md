# Mango_tree_satellite_data
#High Resolution remote sensing images of study area by Google Earth Engine were used for this study. The images extracted are in the visible range of the spectrum and have a resolution of 1162 x 632. The images representing various regions of the orchard containing four (Alphonso, Dasheri, Langra and Chausa) varieties of mango trees, young and old, intermixed with other vegetation, were handpicked to prepare a diverse dataset. Images containing trees that seemed ambiguous through visual inspection were cropped to remove the ambiguity.
